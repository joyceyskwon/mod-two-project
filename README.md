# README

Thank you for using Spoonify (Hoggle) application!

* About the Application

Who likes to go to their favorite places to eat? Essentially everyone I know does, and not only do they like to go, but also recommend places to their close friends and families. This app not only allows you to create your own personal lists (favorite brunch spots, romantic dinner spots, instagrammable dessert spots and more), but also allows you to follow other people's lists to expand your hip and hot places near you. What's more awesome is that you can reserve those restaurants if you want through the app, without having to make a second visit at their website.

* Database

This app uses restaurant API that uses geo-location to better search for restaurants.

* Goals

This is a first version and the next version will have more additional features, like incentive programs via points you get from number of reservations made by your followers through your lists. That would be really awesome!

<!-- user is able to add new restaurants from others' lists -->
<!-- user is able to make reservation -->
<!-- user is able to follow other people's lists -->

<!-- This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
