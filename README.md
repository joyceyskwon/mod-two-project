Thank you for using Spoonify!

* About Spoonify

Who likes to go to their favorite places to eat? Essentially everyone I know does, and not only do they like to go, but also recommend places to their close friends and families. This app not only allows you to create your own personal lists (favorite brunch spots, romantic dinner spots, instagram-mable dessert places and more), but also allows you to follow other users to expand your places near you. What's more awesome is that you can reserve those restaurants if you want through this app, without having to make a second visit at their website.

* Database

This app is solely based on users' input!

* Goals

This is only the first version and my next goal is for the next version is to add geo-location model to search places by latitude and longitude. I'll need a 'geocode' ruby gem to convert string addresses to lat and long and a mapbox to add interactive map to show the location. Also, I would add additional features like incentive programs via points you get from number of reservations made by your followers through your lists. That would be really awesome!
